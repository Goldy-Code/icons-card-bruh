        >When a humble bard Graced a ride along With Geralt of Rivia Along came
        this song From when the White Wolf fought A silver-tongued devil His
        army of elves At his hooves did they revel They came after me With
        masterful deceit Broke down my lute And they kicked in my teeth While
        the devil's horns Minced our tender meat And so cried the Witcher He
        can't be bleat Toss a coin to your Witcher Oh, Valley of Plenty Oh,
        Valley of Plenty, oh Toss a coin to your Witcher Oh, Valley of Plenty At
        the edge of the world Fight the mighty horde That bashes and breaks you
        And brings you to mourn He thrust every elf Far back on the shelf High
        up on the mountain From whence it came He wiped out your pest Got kicked
        in his chest He's a friend of humanity So give him the rest That's my
        epic tale Our champion prevailed Defeated the villain Now pour him some
        ale Toss a coin to your Witcher Oh, Valley of Plenty Oh, Valley of
        Plenty, oh Toss a coin to your Witcher A friend of humanity Toss a coin
        to your Witcher Oh, Valley of Plenty Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh Toss a
        coin to your Witcher A friend of humanity Toss a coin to your Witcher
        Oh, Valley of Plenty Oh, Valley of Plenty, ah-ah, oh Toss a coin to your
        Witcher A friend of humanity</marquee>
